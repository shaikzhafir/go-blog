Personally pain, or as a byproduct, persistence is what serves as the best teacher. And the biggest obstacle, is impatience/hastiness<br><br>
[[Haruki Murakami]] mentioned something that resonated a lot with me in his latest autobiography, [[Novelist as a profession]].<br><br>

He paints a scene where there are two good friends who want to learn more about Mt Fuji. The first reads up all about Mount Fuji's history, looks at it from afar and decides that he has learnt all there is to know about it 
The second, chooses to climb up Mount Fuji, all the way to the summit. At the top, looking at the view, only then he is satisfied and feels he has grasped what Mount Fuji really is.<br><br> 

I don't think I am fully either of these sorts of people. I consider myself to be 80% the laborious person , and 20% hoping that the easy way out is possible, where it just clicks. 
Perhaps as an extension to the Fuji guys story, the one who did not have to climb it perhaps has already climbed a few other mountains, and he did not have to go through the entire process of climbing a mountain to grok it. <br><br>

Personally pain and time is what serves as the best teacher for me. And the biggest obstacle, is obviously impatience and hastiness
Ideas sometimes needs marinating, and in most cases this act of marination is rather frustrating, or just akin to bashing one's head against a wall. But it is always important to always keep moving forward, or at least, continue hacking at whatever it is we are working on.<br><br>
In most cases, there is always a sense of relief once we break through, and find meaning through all the pain.<br><br>
I need to work on my writing. This is painful.
