Personally pain, or as a byproduct, persistence is what serves as the best teacher. And the biggest obstacle, is impatience/hastiness<br><br>
Ideas sometimes needs marinating, and in most cases this act of marination is rather frustrating, or just akin to bashing one's head against a wall. But it is always important to always keep moving forward, or at least, continue hacking at whatever it is we are working on.<br><br>
In most cases, there is always a sense of relief once we break through, and find meaning through all the pain.<br><br>
I need to work on my writing. This is painful.
